Digital Library Changelog
*11.03.2015*



**Changes**

* Turned off the map panning to include only relevant results when mouse over as it was psychedelic and drove people crazy.  Functionality still exists for potential later use.

* Turned off rendering of bounding boxes until some more discussion about data and display time are completed.  Make map marker interaction clearer for the moment.



**Added**

* Prevented zooming of the map with scroll wheels as sometimes can cause UX problems.
